<div id="about-yeti">
<strong><a href="/#about-yeti">YETI</a> <strong> is an open source</strong> project based on SBC module of <a target="_blank"  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iptel.org/sems">SEMS</a>. 
The main goal is to move <strong>routing logic and entire softswitch behaviour to a separated layer</strong>.
This approach provides flexibility, ability to quickly add a non-trivial features and simply integrate it with other systems. 
It is possible to completely change the business logic by changing only the management layer component.

<strong>YETI</strong> consists of few separate parts:
<ul>
	<li>Core - modified <a target="_blank"  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iptel.org/sems">SEMS</a> and YETI SEMS module binaries.</li>
	<li>Management layer - set of tables and appropriate PL/pgSQL stored procedures. As a database system we have chosen <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.</li>
	<li>Web-interface to manage YETI on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a>.</li>
</ul>
