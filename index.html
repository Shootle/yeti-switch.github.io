---
<p>
<strong>YETI</strong> is project based on SBC module of <a target="_blank"  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iptel.org/sems">SEMS</a>. 
The main goal is to provide ability to control <strong>routing logic and entire softswitch behaviour from database</strong>. 
This approach provides  flexibility, ability to quickly add a non-trivial features and simply integrate with other systems. 
It is possible to completely change the business logic without having to change any code (except of database stored procedures).
</p>
<strong>YETI</strong> consist of few separate parts:
<ul>
	<li>Core - modified <a target="_blank"  rel="nofollow" href="http://www.iptel.org/sems">SEMS</a> and YETI SEMS module binaries</li>
	<li>Database - set of tables and appropriate PL/pgSQL stored procedures. As a database system we have chosen <a rel="nofollow" href="http://www.postgresql.org/">PostgreSQL</a>.</li>
	<li>Web-interface to manage YETI on <a target="_blank" rel="nofollow" href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a></li>
</ul>
